# ATC game for Pebble
An ATC game for the Pebble Time and Time Steel.
Future versions may include Pebble Classic and Steel, when firmware 3.x is available for said devices.

<b>INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE</b>
When the app is launched, the plane (the diamond) will spawn in the middle of the screen (soon to be made MORE random, hence the dots around the outside). It is your job to vector the aircraft to the final approach fix, the green circle outline.
Press select to choose a heading for the aircraft. Headings are limited for the moment. Scroll up and down to select a different heading.
Press select again to tell the aircraft which direction to fly. It will fly infinitely on that heading, so don't forget to change it now and again. 
Once the aircraft is close to/in the outlined circle, hold down select to clear the aircraft for approach. It will then fly down the localiser path without need for interaction.

<b>DISCLAIMER:</b>
This game is still in very early development. There will be bugs. There will be things that could do with adding, fixing or removing. For now, if you have any suggestions, send me an email at mlb406@gmail.com.
